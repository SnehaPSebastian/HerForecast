# HerForecast

HerForecast is a FemTech concept designed to help women understand and optimize their daily readiness by interpreting body signals across the menstrual cycle. The goal is to go beyond traditional wearables and provide real-time, personalized guidance without manual tracking.

---

## Problem Statement
A woman’s emotional readiness, mental bandwidth, and daily resilience shift across her menstrual cycle. Yet today’s wearables do not capture this.

---

## Core Value
HerForecast uses an intelligence algorithm to interpret physiological signals and determine daily readiness in real time — without manual tracking or guesswork.

---

## Workflow
1. Identify physiological biomarkers in menstruating women  
2. Select relevant datasets (e.g., PhysioNet)  
3. Review literature and extract important tables  
4. Data cleaning and normalization  
5. Train machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM)  
6. Use prompt engineering for interpretable states  
7. Backend development (Python model + API endpoints)  
8. Model validation  
9. Frontend interface for user interaction

## Healthcare Impact
- 20–30% earlier detection of stress patterns  
- 15–25% reduction in productivity loss  
- 10–20% improvement in task efficiency during high-readiness windows  
- Up to 25% lower burnout risk with early behavioral adjustment  
- Positioned within a $60B+ global FemTech market opportunity by 2027

## Future Scaling
- Menstrual cycle tracking and history log  
- Conversational interaction (voice assistant)  
- Life-stage specific guidance (menarche, reproductive years, post-partum, peri-menopause)
